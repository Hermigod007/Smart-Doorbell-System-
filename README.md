# Smart-Doorbell-System-
We developed a smart doorbell system using the Raspberry Pi's Pi Camera Module. When the doorbell button is pressed, the system detects any object in front, captures an image, and sends a notification to the user, alerting them that someone is at the doorstep. Additionally, a buzzer sound serves as the doorbell alert.
